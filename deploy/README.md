# Nanobot Gateway Deployment

This deploys the marketing-agent Nanobot gateway on the Lightsail instance.

Expected paths:

```text
/opt/marketing-agent/nanobot-custom
/opt/marketing-agent/client-marketing-assistance
/opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/config.json
/opt/marketing-agent/secrets/nanobot.env
```

`nanobot.env` should be owned by `root:marketing-agent` with mode `0640` so
systemd and the `marketing-agent` service user can read it. The Nanobot config
lives under `.nanobot` because Nanobot derives runtime directories from the
config file parent and needs to write cron, media, and credential state there.

`nanobot-config.json` attaches the context repo through:

```json
"contextRepos": [
  {
    "path": "/opt/marketing-agent/client-marketing-assistance",
    "readOnly": false,
    "autoSync": false
  }
]
```

`nanobot.env` provides runtime environment for the context repo scripts,
including `OAUTH_BROKER_INTERNAL_URL` and `OAUTH_BROKER_INTERNAL_API_KEY`.

## First Install

Clone the Nanobot repo into `/opt/marketing-agent/nanobot-custom`, then run:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/marketing-agent/nanobot-custom/deploy/scripts/update_nanobot_gateway.sh
sudoedit /opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/config.json
sudoedit /opt/marketing-agent/secrets/nanobot.env
sudo systemctl enable --now nanobot-gateway
```

Required values:

- Telegram bot token in `/opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/config.json`.
- Telegram `allowFrom` or `allowChats` in `/opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/config.json`.
- Provider API key in `/opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/config.json`, or through `NANOBOT_*` env vars.
- `OAUTH_BROKER_INTERNAL_API_KEY` in `nanobot.env`; it must match the OAuth
  broker's internal API key.

## Client Delivery and Verification Gate

Client-facing scheduled workflows (Daily Trend Pulse, Daily Content Idea,
Weekly Performance Review) publish their verified result deterministically to
the client group (`-5340461568`).  Delivery must NOT depend on the
owner-notification evaluator.

The framework exposes `payload.skip_verification` per job.  For every
client-facing job the runtime requires an explicit `PASS` verification verdict
before publishing to the group; a `FAIL`, `PARTIAL`, or missing verdict never
reaches the group and is surfaced as an operational failure (owner alert).

Meaning of `skip_verification` per job:

- `false` (default) — the framework's internal verifier runs and produces the
  deterministic PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL verdict that gates client delivery.
- `true` — the internal verifier is skipped (used by the Daily Meta analytics
  sync, whose `deliver=false` means no automatic group delivery at all).

So, for the scheduled client jobs:

| Job | skip_verification | deliver | Behavior |
|-----|-------------------|---------|----------|
| Daily Trend Pulse | false | true | PASS -> group; FAIL/PARTIAL/missing -> no group + owner alert |
| Daily Content Idea | false | true | PASS -> group; FAIL/PARTIAL/missing -> no group + owner alert |
| Weekly Performance Review | false | true | PASS -> group; FAIL/PARTIAL/missing -> no group + owner alert |
| Daily Meta analytics sync | true | false | success -> silent; partial/failure -> owner DM only |

`evaluate_response` remains only for owner-notification behaviour and never
gates required client-group delivery.


## Multiple Cron Destinations

Cron jobs keep `payload.channel` and `payload.to` as their primary execution
and delivery context. To deliver the same completed result to other chats
without running the workflow again, add `additionalDestinations` to the job in
`/opt/marketing-agent/.nanobot/workspace/cron/jobs.json`:

```json
{
  "payload": {
    "deliver": true,
    "channel": "telegram",
    "to": "PRIMARY_DM_CHAT_ID",
    "additionalDestinations": [
      {
        "channel": "telegram",
        "to": "GROUP_CHAT_ID"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Each destination is de-duplicated before delivery. Telegram groups must still
be approved through `channels.telegram.allowChats` in `config.json`.

For low-latency marketing operations, the example config maps common Telegram
slash commands such as `/connection_status` and `/sync_meta_analytics` directly
to context-repo scripts. Commands not listed in `fastCommands` still go through
the normal agent loop.

## Updates

Use:

```bash
sudo bash /opt/marketing-agent/nanobot-custom/deploy/scripts/update_nanobot_gateway.sh
```

The update script pulls the configured branch and only redeploys/restarts the
gateway when Nanobot code changed, or when the service is not active.

## Operations

```bash
sudo systemctl status nanobot-gateway --no-pager
sudo journalctl -u nanobot-gateway -n 100 --no-pager
sudo tail -n 100 /opt/marketing-agent/logs/nanobot-gateway.log
```
